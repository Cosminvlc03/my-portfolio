<h1>The best movies according to Cosmin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1. Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>I will always have a soft spot for this movie. The combination between a comedy and a love story type of movie, mixed with all those pop-culture references and wonderful acting
just makes me love this movie
</p>
<h3>2. Star wars(the original trilogy+the prequels)</h3>
<p>I know, I know, it was supposed to be just one, but these movies bring out the best of them when you watch them all. After all, you wouldn't understand ROTJ, if you didn't 
watch ESB and ANH. The whole story is just perfect, the setting amazing and for movies this old, the effects are impressing. If I really had to pick one of these though, it would
probably be ROTS or ESB. </p>
<h3>Django Unchained</h3>
<p>You can never go wrong with a Tarantino movie. The western setting makes an embracing story when combined with the characters played by these wonderful actors. It's packed with 
action, but not over-the-top, carefully placed when you feel there should be.
